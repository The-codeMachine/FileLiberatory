# FileLiberatory

--- 

This is a free, and opensource tool used for searching through your files. It is similar to a replacement for Window 11's original File Explorer. 

Windows 11's built in file explorer tool is slow, and comes with very few tools. This tool has:

- Efficient Searching (using SQLite3)
- Built in tools like encryption (using OpenSSL)
- Optimized C++ code 
- An API for other tools to use our .db file of all the file paths
- Watches for changes to update the database

If you have an suggestions, or want to help, contact @The-codeMachine.
